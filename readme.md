## structure of the code 
In this project, I created a html document that containes the container and form element that handle `add-new-a-element`.
After that, I grabbed all the element that I need from that document. There are types of `js file` with this code, which I stored every functionality of code. I mean, I refactored the code so that every one of the code has its file. What I (with this project) so far is displaying the elements, refactoring the code and adding a new element but it value is still undefined.

## Any project improvements possible?
Possibly, if I had more time to code, I would still finished the rest rest of the requirements.
 
## Experience
Debugging while importing and exporting code was the most challenging part for me as it took me lots of time to find where the bugs are.

## What have you learned/improved?

##  Any wisdom to share? :)
